It is known that AAiT as an institute of technology aspires to be among the top five African pre-eminent Technological institutes by 2023; 
to this end, it is inarguable that the role of students working not only independently but also as a functional whole towards improving performance is crucial.
 Here in AAiT, such areas that facilitate team work are scarce, especially for undergraduates. Thus, it is the intention of our club to fill in that void by engaging our members i
